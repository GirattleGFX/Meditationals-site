# Discord Bot Website Template

A easy to use website template for your Discord bot!

This website template uses vars for all the colors, so if you need to change the background color, the main color, or even the text color, just go to the top of the **css/style.css** folder and change them in the root tag!

## Get Started

This is all the HTML coding for the webpage, go here to change the text, layout, links, and more!

### ← style.css

This is where all the websites CSS is, go here to change the colors of the background, text, and primary color!

### ← script.js

This is where the main JavaScript coding is, for the navBar, smooth scrolling, and more. Don't touch this file unless you know what your doing! XD
